He has few fields and he can’t get enough food for his family. He’s often worried about it. So he works harder and harder and tries his best to get more money. One afternoon, Mr. Read went out to look for some grass for his cows. It was very hot and he had to have a swim. Suddenly he saw something sparkling（闪闪发光）in the water. He swam there and found it was some gold in the sand. He was so happy that he hardly forgot he was in the river. He ran home and asked his son to help him to get all the gold out of the water. The next morning he sent his son to sell it in the markets. But the young man was afraid to do it. He had to go to the town himself. He didn’t pay any attention to the traffic lights when he crossed the street. A car hit him down and he was hurt. He was sent to hospital at once. The doctors looked him over and had an operation on him. Two months later he felt much better. The doctors were satisfied with the operation and said, “You’ll </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">be fully recovered</span><span xml:space="preserve"> in a week.
